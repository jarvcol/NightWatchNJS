# zemogaNJS

Hi, please check the video (quicktime) on /video to see it running.

To execute this code just run "node nightwatch -e chrome -a carnival" on a terminal while on project root folder "zemogaNJS".

To create the project I used Visual Studio Code, node v10.1.0, nightwatch v0.9.21, ChromeDriver 2.41 and selenium-server-standalone-3.13.0.jar
